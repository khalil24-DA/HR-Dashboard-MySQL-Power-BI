# HR-Dashboard-MySQL-Power-BI
This project demonstrates how to clean and analyze HR-related data using MySQL and visualize the results using Power BI. The project focuses on extracting, transforming, and cleaning data by handling date conversions, using subqueries. The cleaned data is saved as CSV files, which can later be imported into Power BI for visualization.
